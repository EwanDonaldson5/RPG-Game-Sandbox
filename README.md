# RPG-Game-Sandbox
A demonstration of the game I am creating. This sandbox contains an enemy, weapons, consumables, and environment items.

This game runs through the Unity editor.

Upon loading the game there is an enemy and various items in the game.
Use WASD and Space to move your character. Press E to pickup and Q to drop items and weapons.
Left click will consume consumables and attack with weapons.
Attacking enemies will result in them losing health. There is no visual display for this as health is displayed in the console.

When you start this sandbox the enemy will attack by default. You can either run out of its target range or kill them.
